		<h1>introduction</h1>
			<p>
				this web page is meant to be an introduction to the basics of frontend web devolepment for <br>
				complete beginers this will includes: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
			</p>
	<article>
		<h1>HTML definition</h1>
			<p>
				HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is consider the back bone of a web page<br>
				because it defines the content and structure of a web page,
			</p>
		<h1>html elements</h1>
			<p>
				while reading html files you will encounter allot of elements that begins <br>
				with an opening tag "&lt;&gt;" and a closing tag "&lt;/&gt;"
			</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>titles element</strong></li>
				<p>
					title element can be used once in your file to give your page a 
					name like the one <br>obove that says "web introduction" 
					<strong>the syntax to use that element :</strong><br><br>
						<span class="syntax">
							"&lt;title&gt; your title &lt;/title&gt;" .
						</span>
					<br>
				</p>
			<li><strong>paragraphs</strong></li>
				<p>
					paragraph element are used to insert text to your page and this 
					current text is written <br>using this element<strong>.the syntax to use that element </strong>:<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
						"&lt;p&gt; your paragraph &lt;/p&gt;" .
					</span>
					<br>
				</p>
			<li><strong>headings</strong></li>
				<p>as the name says this element is used to add headings to your
					web page there are up to <br>
					6 hedings as the number increment the size of the heding decrement.<br>
					<strong>the syntax to use that element :</strong><br><br>
						<span class="syntax">
							"&lt;h1..6&gt; &lt;/h1..6 &gt;."
						</span>
					<br>
				</p>
			<li><strong>unordered lists</strong></li>
				<p>
					unordered lists are used to create bulleted lists such as the one 
					that i used in this page to type the<br>
					elements (paragraphs headings ...).<br>
					<strong>the syntax to use that element </strong>:<br><br>
						<span class="syntax">
							"&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;li&gt;... &lt;ul&gt;". <br>
						</span>
					<br>
					inside &lt;ul&gt; element (unordered list) you can add your &lt;li&gt; elements
					here is an examle:<br><br>
						<span class="syntax">
							&lt;ul&gt;<br>
							&lt;li&gt; part 1 &lt;/li&gt;<br>
							&lt;li&gt; part 2 &lt;/li&gt;<br>
							&lt;/ul&gt;<br><br>
						</span>
					this will make a bulleted list of two parts (part 1 and part 2).
				</p></p>
			<li><strong>ordered lists</strong></li>
				<p>
					ordered lists are the same as unordered lists, exesept that instead of using points<br>
					to mark the nodes of the list, it uses number in assending order.<br>
					<strong>the syntax to use that element :</strong><br><br>
						<span class="syntax">
							"&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;li&gt;... &lt;ol&gt;".
						</span>
					<br>
				</p>
		</ul>

			<h1>inserting media</h1>
				<ol>
					<li><h2>images</h2></li>
						<p>
							to add an image to your web page you should use the syntax that is shown in 
							this image 
							</p>
								<img src="media/html-image-tag.png"width="350" height="150" alt="image syntax"/>
							<p>
							as you see the image element is deffrent from the others it is called a <em>self 
							closing tag</em> and <br>
							inside this element we should add an <em>atribute </em>that is called <strong>"src"
							</strong> were we can write the source<br> of our
							image we can also add the <strong>"width"</strong> and <strong>"height"</strong> 
							atributes to chage the size of the imge<br>
							it is considered a good practice to add an atribute that is called <strong>"alt"
							</strong> to give your image<br>
							an alternative text if the image failed to load.
						</p>

					<li><h2>videos</h2></li>
						<p>
							to add videos to your page you should use the folowing syntax:<br><br>
							<span class="syntax">
								<strong>&lt;video src = (source of video) controls &gt; "txt alt" &lt;/video&gt;</strong><br>
							</span>
							<br>
							the <strong>controls</strong> is used to tell the browser to add basic controls to
							your video such as <em>play/pause</em> button<br>
							and sound control, your can also modify the height and lenght of your video the same way we 
							do to images <br> you can also put the alternative text between the opening and closing tags. <br>
							here is an example :
						</p>
						<video src="media/Colin's Bear Animation.mp4" controls>
							random video
						</video>

					<li><h2>audio</h2></li>
						<p>
							to add an audio to your page you should use the folowing syntax:<br><br>
							<span class="syntax">
								<strong>&lt;audio src = (source of audio) controls &gt; "txt alt" &lt;/audio&gt;</strong><br>
							</span>
							<br>
							the <strong>controls</strong> is used to tell the browser to add basic controls to your audio
							such as <em>play/pause</em> <br>button
							sound control if you need to put an alternative text put between the opening and closing tags. <br>
							here is an example :
						</p>
						<audio src="media/inocent_audio.mp3" controls>
							rick roll
						</audio>
			</ol>

		<h1>forms and input elements</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><h2>forms ?</h2></li>
				<p>
					inside the opening and closing tags of the form element we can build a form that contains <em>input 
					elements</em> <br>the use of this form element <strong>"&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;"</strong> isn't graphicly<br>
					necessary but it is a ogligatory in future since we will need the information passed by the user when we will <br>
					learn about <strong><em>Java Script</em></strong> and <strong><em>CSS.</em></strong>
				</p>
			<li><h3>input elements</h3></li>
				<p>
					input elements are used to recive data from a client that uses your Web page here is an example :
				</p>
			<input>
				<p>
					the syntax i used to visualize this text holder is this :<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
						"&lt;input&gt;"<br><br>
					</span>
						inside this element we can add inputs labels ...
				</p>
			<li><h3>input attributes</h3></li>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>type</strong></li>
					<p>
						in terms of inputs in <em>HTML</em> there are alot of types such as numbres texts dates ext...<br>
						for example the folowing input has it's type atribute set to <strong><em>"date":</em></strong>
					<br><br><input type="date"><br>
					<br> and this one has it's type atribute set to <strong><em>"number":</em></strong><br><br>
					<input type="number"><br><br>
					to add this attribute to your input use this syntax &lt;input type "desired type"&gt;<br>
					</p>
				<li><strong>id</strong></li>
					<p>
						id attribute must be unique within the entire HTML document <br>
						The id attribute is often used to uniquely identify and manipulate specific elements <br>
						using JavaScript so it is considered a good practice to be prepared for future project
					</p>
				<li><strong>name</strong></li>
					<p>
						we can consider that this atribute declares a variable in wich we will store the <br>
						text we got form the user and just like the previos atribute we can't really benifit <br> 
						from this atribute while using html only it will usfell after learning JavaScript
					</p>
				<li><strong>placeholder</strong></li>
				<p>
					this element is used to add a transparent text inside your input element here is an example:<br>
				</p>
				<input type="text" placeholder="text only"><br>
				<p>
					as we see in this case <em>"text only"</em> is transparently written inside our inout element.</em>
				</p>
			</ol>
			<li><h3>label element</h3></li>
				<p>
				this element is usually used before the input element to write a text before the actual input to provide <br>
				an instruction or anything you desire here is an example: <br>
				</p>
				<label for="txt">write your name</label>
				<input type ="text" id="txt">
				<p>
					the syntax i used in this case above i used this before the input element this syntax :<br>
					<strong>"&lt;label&gt;'my text'&lt;/label&gt;</strong>"
				</p>
			<li><h4>for atribute</h4></li>
				<p>
					this atribute is used to make your label intractive so that if you click on the label text in our examle it will<br> automaticly
					 take you inside the input element this is a good practice the way you can add this to your page is by adding a<br>
			 		<strong>for atribute</strong> and giving it the same value of the id atribute of your input.
				</p>
		</ul>

	<h1>using CSS</h1>
		<h2>definition</h2>
			<p>
				when you write pure html code the browser uses it's default boring styling, and here is where CSS is usfull.<br>
				<strong>CSS </strong> stands for <strong>"Cascading Style Sheets"</strong> it is the language used to style your web page <br>
				it has all the defrent features like adding colors, change writing syles, controling text position and alot more.
			</p>
		<h2>linking CSS with html</h2>
			<p>
				to apply CSS to your html file, the most used way is to creat a css file and link it with your html file using the link element <br>
				and set the <em>"href"</em> attribute to the path of your css file then add a <em>rel</em> attribute (realtionship) and set it to "stylesheet"<br>
				make sure the new link element is located within a head element<br>
				<strong>here is the syntax :</strong><br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;<br><br>
				</span>
				or alternatively for quick styling without having to creat a new file you can use the html style element here is the syntax:<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					&lt;style&gt;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;h1{<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br> 
					&lt;/style&gt;<br><br>
				</span>
				the syntax inside the style element is the same syntax used inside a CSS file wich is explained next.
			</p>

		<h2>basic CSS syntax</h2>
		<p>
			lets say we want to style one of the HTML elements. <strong>here is the syntax:</strong><br><br>
			<span class="syntax">
				selector {<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property=valeu;<br>
				}<br><br>
			</span>
			the <em>selector</em> is mainly used to chose the html element we want to apply the changes on it<br>
			the <em>property</em> is used to specify the thing you want to chage (color, size, font ,etc...)<br>
			and the <em>valeu</em> depends on the property, for example if the property is set to color <br>
			the valeu should be a color (rgb(231, 6, 6) or just red) and if the property is a font-family <br>
			the value should be the desired font name (Arial (sans-serif), Verdana) etc...<br>
		</p>
	
		<h2>some css properties</h2>
			<p>
				in CSS there is a large collection of properties and each property can have defrent type of valeu <br>
				depending on the property itself but we are only going to cover a minimal amount of them <br>
				here is a full list : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php"> full list link </a> 
			</p>
		<ul>
			<li>color</li>
				<p>
					this property is strait forward, it allows you to change the color of the specified selector.<br>
					you can give it the color name directly like this: "color: red".<br>
					you can also use the rgb foramation of the color you want like this : "color: rgb(100, 0, 204);"
				</p>
			<li>background</li>
				<p>
					there are several properties to manipulate the appearance of the element background:
					<ol>
						<li>background color</li>
							<p>
								if you want to change the background color of the selector you can do it like this: <br>
								<span class="syntax">
									selector {<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color="red";<br>
									}<br><br>
								</span>
							</p>
						<li>background Transparency</li>
							<p>
								this property is only usfulle when the background-color is also used so that you can midify<br>
								the Transparency of the background of an element using this syntax:<br><br>
								<span class="syntax">
									selector {<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color="red";<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opacity: 0.5;";<br>
									}<br><br>
								</span>
								the default opacity valeu is 1 so that means the examle abouve will reduce the Transparency of <br>
								the red background by 50%.
							</p>
						<li>image as a background</li>
							<p>
								to show an image as the background of some element we can use the "background-image" property like this:<br>
								<span class="syntax">
									selector {<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color="red";<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opacity: 0.5;";<br>
									}<br><br>
								</span>
							</p>
					</ol>
				</p>	
		</ul>

		<h2>more CSS selector usages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>multiple selectors</li>
			<p>
				the selector part of the CSS syntax can be used for more than just selecting one html element there are some additional features<br>
				for example you can applly the same changes to a group of elements by setting the selector to all the elements like this:<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					h2, h3, h4 {<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: black;<br>
					}<br><br>
				</span>
				this will set the background color of all the specified elements (h2, h3, h4) to black color. <br>
				this syntax allows you to apply the same styling to multiple of elements without<br>
				having to write each one individually.<br>
			</p>
			<li>using class as selector</li>
			<p>
				class is an html atribute that can be shared acros multiple elements here is how we can benifit from it in CSS :<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					.class_value{<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;<br>
					}<br><br>
				</span>
				this syntax abouve is used to make all the elements with an atribute class of value "class_value" follow the specified style changes <br>
				in our case the changes will apply to every element no matter what type as long as its class atribute is set to the same value used
				as the selector .<br>
				you can also use it in that way:<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					p.class_val{<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: center;<br>
					}<br><br>
				</span>
				the defrence here is that we specified both of the html element and class we want to target <br>
				wich means only the &lt;p&gt; elements that have a valeu of "class_val" will be aligned to the center<br> 
			</p>
			<li>uinvesal selector</li>
				<p>
					sometimes you want to make some changes on all of you html elements without exepetions here is how:<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
						*{<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: center;<br>
						}<br><br>
					</span>
					when a '*' character is used as the selector, the styling will be applied to all of the elements.
				</p>
			<li>id as a selector</li>
				<p>
					the id is an html attribute the defrence between an id and a class is that each element can have a unique id<br>
					wich means if we use as out CSS selector it will be applied to the element with that same id here is it's syntax:<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
						#id-valeu{<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br>
						}<br><br>
					</span>
				</p>
