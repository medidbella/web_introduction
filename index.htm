			<h1 style="color: rgba(12, 160, 245, 0.911);"><strong><br>web dev introduction</strong></h1>
				<p style="color: black; font-weight: 900;">
					this web page is meant to be an introduction to the basics of frontend web development for <br>
					complete beginners this will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
				</p>
		</div>

			<h1><strong><br>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong></h1>
	<article>
		<div>
		<h2>definition</h2>
			<p>
				HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is consider the back bone of a web page
				because it defines the content and structure of a web page,
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2><strong>basic html elements</strong></h2>
			<p>
				while reading html files you will encounter a lot of elements that begins 
				with an opening tag &lt;&gt; and a closing tag &lt;/&gt;
			</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>titles element</strong></li>
				<p>
					title element can be used once in your file to give your page a 
					name like the one obove that says "web introduction" 
					<strong>the syntax to use that element :</strong>
									<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
							&lt;title&gt; your title &lt;/title&gt;
					</span>
					<br><br>
				</p>
			<li><strong>paragraphs</strong></li>
				<p>
					paragraph element are used to insert text to your page and this 
					current text is written using this element<strong>.the syntax to use that element </strong>:
								<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
						&lt;p&gt; your paragraph &lt;/p&gt; 
					</span>
					<br><br>		
				</p>
			<li><strong>headings</strong></li>
				<p>
					as the name says this element is used to add headings to your
					web page there are up to 
					6 hedings as the number increment the size of the heding decrement.
					<strong>the syntax to use that element :</strong>
					<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
							&lt;h1..6&gt; &lt;/h1..6 &gt;
					</span>
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<li><strong>unordered lists</strong></li>
				<p>
					unordered lists are used to create bulleted lists such as the one 
					that i used in this page to type the
					elements (paragraphs headings ...).
					<strong>the syntax to use that element </strong>:
									<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
							&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;li&gt;... &lt;ul&gt;
					</span>
					<br><br>
					inside &lt;ul&gt; element (unordered list) you can add your &lt;li&gt; elements
					here is an examle:<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
							&lt;ul&gt;
							&lt;li&gt; part 1 &lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt; part 2 &lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;/ul&gt;
					</span>
					<br><br>			
					this will make a bulleted list of two parts (part 1 and part 2).
				</p></p>
			<li><strong>ordered lists</strong></li>
				<p>
					ordered lists are the same as unordered lists, except that instead of using points
					to mark the nodes of the list, it uses number in assending order.
					<strong>the syntax to use that element :</strong>
									<br><br>
						<span class="syntax">
							&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;li&gt;... &lt;ol&gt;
						</span>
						<br><br>
				</p>
			<li> <strong>"strong" and "em" elements</strong> </li>
				<p>
					the "strong" element is used to make the characters and font of a piece of text that 
					is inclosed within this element darker and bigger here is an examle:
					<strong> "word"</strong> this "word" is writen inside the strong element
					<strong>here is the syntax used :</strong>
								<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
						&lt;strong&gt; "the text you desire" &lt;/strong&gt;
					</span>
					<br><br>
					on the other hand the "em" element is used the in same way (same syntax) but the result of using 
					this element is defrent, it slightly emphasis the text here is an example : <em>hello</em>

			<h2><strong>inserting media</strong></h2>
				<ol>
					<li><h2>images</h2></li>
						<p>
							to add an image to your web page you should use the syntax that is shown in 
							this image 
							</p>
								<img src="media/html-image-tag.png"width="350" height="150" alt="image syntax"/>
							<p>
							as you see the image element is different from the others it is called a <em>self 
							closing tag</em> and 
							inside this element we should add an <em>atribute </em>that is called <strong>"src"
							</strong> were we can write the source of our
							image we can also add the <strong>"width"</strong> and <strong>"height"</strong> 
							atributes to chage the size of the imge
							it is considered a good practice to add an atribute that is called <strong>"alt"
							</strong> to give your image
							an alternative text if the image failed to load.
						</p>

					<li><h2>videos</h2></li>
						<p>
							to add videos to your page you should use the folowing syntax:
										<br><br>
							<span class="syntax">
								<strong>&lt;video src = (source of video) controls &gt; "txt alt" &lt;/video&gt;</strong>
							</span>
							<br><br>					
							the <strong>controls</strong> is used to tell the browser to add basic controls to
							your video such as <em>play/pause</em> button
							and sound control, your can also modify the height and lenght of your video the same way we 
							do to images  you can also put the alternative text between the opening and closing tags. 
							here is an example :
						</p>
						<video src="media/Colin's Bear Animation.mp4" controls>
							random video
						</video>

					<li><h2>audio</h2></li>
						<p>
							to add an audio to your page you should use the folowing syntax:
										<br><br>
							<span class="syntax">
								<strong>&lt;audio src = (source of audio) controls &gt; "txt alt" &lt;/audio&gt;</strong>
							</span>
							<br><br>						
							the <strong>controls</strong> is used to tell the browser to add basic controls to your audio
							such as <em>play/pause</em> button
							sound control if you need to put an alternative text put between the opening and closing tags. 
							here is an example :
						</p>
						<audio src="media/inocent_audio.mp3" controls>
							rick roll
						</audio>
			</ol>

		<h2><strong>forms and input elements</strong></h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h2>forms ?</h2></li>
				<p>
					inside the opening and closing tags of the form element we can build a form that contains <em>input 
					elements</em> the use of this form element <strong>&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</strong> isn't graphicly
					necessary but it is a ogligatory in future since we will need the information passed by the user when we will 
					learn about <strong><em>Java Script</em></strong> and <strong><em>CSS.</em></strong>
				</p>
			<li><h3>input elements</h3></li>
				<p>
					input elements are used to recive data from a client that uses your Web page here is an example :
				</p>
			<input>
				<p>
					the syntax i used to visualize this text holder is this :
					<br><br>
			<span class="syntax">
						&lt;input&gt;
					</span>
					<br><br>				
						inside this element we can add inputs labels ...
				</p>
			<li><h3>input attributes</h3></li>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>type</strong></li>
					<p>
						in terms of inputs in <em>HTML</em> there are alot of types such as numbres texts dates ext...
						for example the folowing input has it's type atribute set to <strong><em>"date":</em></strong>
					<br><input type="date"><br>
					 and this one has it's type atribute set to <strong><em>"number":</em></strong>
					<br><input type="number"><br>
					to add this attribute to your input use this syntax:<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
						&lt;input type="desired type"&gt;
					</span>

					</p>
				<li><strong>id</strong></li>
					<p>
						id attribute must be unique within the entire HTML document 
						The id attribute is often used to uniquely identify and manipulate specific elements 
						using JavaScript so it is considered a good practice to be prepared for future project
					</p>
				<li><strong>name</strong></li>
					<p>
						we can consider that this atribute declares a variable in wich we will store the 
						text we got form the user and just like the previos atribute we can't really benifit  
						from this atribute while using html only it will usfell after learning JavaScript
					</p>
				<li><strong>placeholder</strong></li>
				<p>
					this element is used to add a transparent text inside your input element here is an example:
				</p>
				<input type="text" placeholder="text only">
				<p>
					as we see in this case <em>"text only"</em> is transparently written inside our inout element.</em>
				</p>
			</ol>
			<li><h3>label element</h3></li>
				<p>
				this element is usually used before the input element to write a text before the actual input to provide 
				an instruction or anything you desire here is an example: 
				</p>
				<label for="txt">write your name</label>
				<input type ="texte" id="txt">
				<p>
					the syntax i used in this case above i used this before the input element this syntax :
									<br><br>
			<span class="syntax">
							&lt;label&gt;'my text'&lt;/label&gt;
						</span>
				<br><br>				
				</p>
			<li><h4>for atribute</h4></li>
				<p>
					this atribute is used to make your label intractive so that if you click on the label text in our examle it will automaticly
					 take you inside the input element this is a good practice the way you can add this to your page is by adding a
			 		<strong>for atribute</strong> and giving it the same value of the id atribute of your input.
				</p>
		</ul>

	<h1><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)<strong></h1>
	<article id="CSS">
		<h2>definition</h2>
			<p>
				when you write pure html code the browser uses it's default boring styling, and here is where CSS is usfull.
				<strong>CSS </strong> stands for <strong>"Cascading Style Sheets"</strong> it is the language used to style your web page 
				it has all the defrent features like adding colors, change writing syles, controling text position and alot more.
			</p>
		<h2>linking CSS with html</h2>
			<p>
				to apply CSS to your html file, the most used way is to creat a css file and link it with your html file using the link element 
				and set the <em>"href"</em> attribute to the path of your css file then add a <em>rel</em> attribute (realtionship) and set it to "stylesheet"
				make sure the new link element is located within a head element
				<strong>here is the syntax :</strong>
							<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
				</span>
				<br><br>
				or alternatively for quick styling without having to creat a new file you can use the html style element here is the syntax:
							<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					&lt;style&gt;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;h1{<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue;
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
					&lt;/style&gt;
				</span>
				<br><br>
				the syntax inside the style element is the same syntax used inside a CSS file wich is explained next.
			</p>
		<h2>basic CSS syntax</h2>
			<p>
				lets say we want to style one of the HTML elements. <strong>here is the syntax:</strong>
				<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					selector {<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property=valeu;<br>
					}
				</span>
				<br><br>
				the <em>selector</em> is mainly used to chose the html element we want to apply the changes on it
				the <em>property</em> is used to specify the thing you want to chage (color, size, font ,etc...)
				and the <em>valeu</em> depends on the property, for example if the property is set to color 
				the valeu should be a color (rgb(231, 6, 6) or just red) and if the property is a font-family 
				the value should be the desired font name (Arial (sans-serif), Verdana) etc...
			</p>
	
		<h2>some css properties</h2>
			<p>
				there is a large collection of properties and each property can have defrent types of possible
				valeu depending on the property itself but in this page we are only going to cover a minimal amount
				<br>here is a full list : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php"> full list link </a> 
			</p>
		<ul>
			<li>color</li>
				<p>
					this property is strait forward, it allows you to change the color of the specified selector.
					you can give it the color name directly like this: "color: red".
					you can also use the rgb foramation of the color you want like this : "color: rgb(100, 0, 204);"
				</p>
			<li>background</li>
					<p>
						there are several properties to manipulate the appearance of the background of an element
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>background color</li>
							<p>
								if you want to change the background color of the selector you can do it like this: 
								<br><br>
								<span class="syntax">
									selector {<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color="red";<br>
									}
								</span>
								<br><br>						
							</p>
						<li>background Transparency</li>
							<p>
								this property is only usefull when the background-color is also used so that you can modify
								the Transparency of the background of an element using this syntax:
											<br><br>
								<span class="syntax">
									selector {<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color="red";<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opacity: 0.5;";<br>
									}
								</span>
								<br><br>
								the default opacity valeu is 1 so that means the examle abouve will reduce the Transparency of 
								the red background by 50%.
							</p>
						<li>image as a background</li>
							<p>
								to show an image as the background of some element we can use the "background-image" property like this:
											<br><br>
								<span class="syntax">
									selector {<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url("image path");<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opacity: 0.5;";<br>
									}
								</span>
								<br><br>
							</p>
					</ol>	
		</ul>

		<h2>more CSS selector usages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>multiple selectors</li>
			<p>
				the selector part of the CSS syntax can be used for more than just selecting one html element there are some additional features
				for example you can applly the same changes to a group of elements by setting the selector to all the elements like this:
				<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					h2, h3, h4 {<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: black;<br>
					}
				</span>
				<br><br>
				this will set the background color of all the specified elements (h2, h3, h4) to black color. 
				this syntax allows you to apply the same styling to multiple of elements without
				having to write each one individually.
			</p>
			<li>using class as selector</li>
			<p>
				class is an html atribute that can be shared acros multiple elements here is how we can benifit from it in CSS :
				<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					.class_value{<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;<br>
					}
				</span>
				<br><br>	
				this syntax abouve is used to make all the elements with an atribute class of value "class_value" follow the specified style changes 
				in our case the changes will apply to every element no matter what type as long as its class atribute is set to the same value used
				as the selector .
				you can also use it in that way:
							<br><br>
				<span class="syntax">
					p.class_val{<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: center;<br>
					}
				</span>
				<br><br>
				the defrence here is that we specified both of the html element and class we want to target 
				wich means only the &lt;p&gt; elements that have a valeu of "class_val" will be aligned to the center 
			</p>
			<li>univesal selector</li>
				<p>
					sometimes you want to make some changes on all of you html elements without excepetions here is how:
					<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
							*{<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: center;<br>
							}
					</span>
					<br><br>
					when a '*' character is used as the selector, the styling will be applied to all of the elements.
				</p>
			<li>id as a selector</li>
				<p>
					the id is an html attribute the defrence between an id and a class is that each element can have a unique id
					wich means if we use as out CSS selector it will be applied to the element with that same id here is it's syntax:
					<br><br>
					<span class="syntax">
						#id-valeu{<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br>
						}
					</span>
					<br><br>
				</p>
