		<h1>introduction</h1>
			<p>
				this web page is meant to be an introduction to the basics of web devolepment
			</p>
	<article>
		<h1>html elements</h1>
			<p>
				in my jurney i learned alot of elements that begins <br>
				with an opening tag "&lt;&gt;" and a closing tag "&lt;/&gt;"
			</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>titles element</strong></li>
				<p>
					title element can be used once in your file to give your page a 
					name like the one <br>obove that says "learnin progresse" 
					<strong>the syntax to use that element :</strong><em>"&lt;title
					&gt; &lt;/title&gt;" .</em>
				</p>
			<li><strong>paragraphs</strong></li>
				<p>
					paragraph element are used to insert text to your page and this 
					current text is written <br>using this element
				<strong>.the syntax to use that element :</strong>
				<em>"&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" .</em>
				</p</p>
			<li><strong>headings</strong></li>
				<p>as the name says this element is used to add headings to your
					web page there are up to <br>
					6 hedings as the number increment the size of the heding decrement
					.<strong><br>
					the syntax to use that element :</strong><em>"&lt;h1..6&gt; &lt;/h1..6
					&gt;." </em>
				</p>
			<li><strong>unordered lists</strong></li>
				<p>
					unordered lists are used to create bulleted lists such as the one 
					that i used in this page to type the<br>
					elements (paragraphs headings ...).<br><strong>the syntax to use that element :
					</strong><em>"&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;li&gt;... &lt;ul&gt;". </em>
				</p></p>
			<li><strong>ordered lists</strong></li>
				<p>
					ordered lists are the oposite of unordered lists inted of using a point 
					to mark the nodes of the list<br>
					it uses number in assending order.<br><strong>the syntax to use that element :
					</strong><em>"&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;li&gt;... &lt;ol&gt;". </em>
				</p>
			</ul>

			<h1>inserting media</h1>
				<ol>
					<li><h2>images</h2></li>
					<p>
						to add an image to your web site you should use the syntax that is shown in 
						this image 
					</p>
				<img src="media/thiiis.png"width="500" height="100" alt="image syntax"/>
					<p>
						as you see the image element is defrent from the others it is called a <em>self 
						closing tag</em> and <br>
						inside this element we should add an <em>atribute </em>that is called <strong>"src"
						</strong> were we can write the source<br> of our
						image we can also add the <strong>"width"</strong> and <strong>"height"</strong> 
						atributes to chage the size of the imge<br>
						it is considered a good practice to add an atribute that is called <strong>"alt"
						</strong> to give your image<br>
						an alternative text if the image failed to load.
					</p>
					<li><h2>videos</h2></li>
					<p>
						to add videos to your page you should use the folowing syntax:<br>
						<strong>&lt;video src = (source of video) controls &gt; "txt alt" &lt;/video&gt;</strong><br>
						the <strong>controls</strong> is used to tell the browser to add basic controls to
						your video such as <em>play/pause</em> button<br>
						sound control your can also modify the height ans leght of your video the same way we 
						do to images <br> if you need to put an alternative text put between the opening and closing tags. <br>
						here is an example :
					</p>
				<video src="media/Colin's Bear Animation.mp4" controls>
					random video
				</video>
				<li><h2>audio</h2></li>
					<p>
						to add an audio to your page you should use the folowing syntax:<br>
						<strong>&lt;audio src = (source of audio) controls &gt; "txt alt" &lt;/audio&gt;</strong><br>
						the <strong>controls</strong> is used to tell the browser to add basic controls to your audio
						 such as <em>play/pause</em> <br>button
						sound control if you need to put an alternative text put between the opening and closing tags. <br>
						here is an example :
					</p>
				<audio src="media/inocent_audio.mp3" controls>
						rick roll
				</audio>
			</ol>

		<h1>forms and input elements</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><h2>forms ?</h2></li>
				<p>
					inside the opening and closing tags of the form element we can build a form that contains <em>input 
					elements</em> <br>the use this form element <strong>"&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;"</strong> isn't graphicly<br>
					necessary but it is a ogligatory in future since we will need the information passed by the user when we will <br>
					learn about <strong><em>Java Script</em></strong> and <strong><em>CSS.</em></strong>
				</p>
			<li><h3>input elements</h3></li>
				<p>
					input elements are used to recive data from a client that uses your Web page here is an example :
				</p>
			<input>
				<p>
					the syntax i used to visualize this text holder is this : "&lt;input&gt;"<br>
					inside this element we can add inputs labels ...
				</p>
			<li><h3>input attributes</h3></li>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>type</strong></li>
					<p>
						in terms of inputs in <em>HTML</em> there are alot of types such as numbres texts dates ext...<br>
						for example the folowing input has it's type atribute set to <strong><em>"date":</em></strong>
					<br><br><input type="date"><br>
					<br> and this one has it's type atribute set to <strong><em>"number":</em></strong><br><br>
					<input type="number"><br><br>
					to add this attribute to your input use this syntax &lt;input type "desired type"&gt;<br>
					</p>
				<li><strong>id</strong></li>
					<p>
						id attribute that must be unique within the entire HTML document. The id attribute is often used to 
						uniquely <br>identify and manipulate specific elements using JavaScript so it is considered a good
						practice to be prepared for future project
					</p>
				<li><strong>name</strong></li>
					<p>
						we can consider that this atribute declares a variable in witch we will store the text we got form the user
						and just like the <br>previos atribute we can't really benifit from this atribute in while using html only it will
						usfell after learning JavaScript
					</p>
				<li><strong>placeholder</strong></li>
				<p>
					this element can be used when you want to add a transparent text to give your input element a title here is an 
					example:<br>
				</p>
				<input type="text" placeholder="text only"><br>
				<p>
					as we see in this case <em>"text only"</em> is transparently written inside our inout element.</em>
				</p>
			</ol>
			<li><h3>label element</h3></li>
				<p>
				this element is usually used before the input element to write a text before the actual input to give the us an 
				instruction or anything you desire <br> here is an example: <br>
				</p>
				<label for="txt">write your name</label>
				<input type ="text" id="txt">
				<p>
					the syntax i used in this case above i used this before the input element this syntax :<br>
					<strong>"&lt;label&gt;'my text'&lt;/label&gt;</strong>"
				</p>
			<li><h4>for atribute</h4></li>
				<p>
					this atribute is used to make your label intractive so that if you click on the label text in our examle it will<br> automaticly
					 take you inside the input element this is a good practice the way you can add this to your page is by adding a<br>
			 		<strong>for atribute</strong> and giving it the same value of the id atribute of your input.
				</p>
		</ul>

<h1>using CSS</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>CSS </strong> stands for <strong>"Cascading Style Sheets"</strong> is a language that is used to style your web page by 
			adding colors change writing syles <br> and label themes ext...
